Named Entity Recognition Task
============

In named entity recognition, one tries to find the strings within a text that correspond to proper names (excluding TIME and MONEY) and classify the type of entity denoted by these strings. The problem is difficult partly due to the ambiguity in sentence segmentation; one needs to extract which words belong to a named entity, and which not. Another difficulty occurs when some word may be used as a name of either a person, an organization or a location. For example, Deniz may be used as the name of a person, or - within a compound - it can refer to a location Marmara Denizi 'Marmara Sea', or an organization Deniz Taşımacılık 'Deniz Transportation'.

The standard approach for NER is a word-by-word classification, where the classifier is trained to label the words in the text with tags that indicate the presence of particular kinds of named entities. After giving the class labels (named entity tags) to our training data, the next step is to select a group of features to discriminate different named entities for each input word.

[<sub>ORG</sub> Türk Hava Yolları] bu [<sub>TIME</sub> Pazartesi'den] itibaren [<sub>LOC</sub> İstanbul] [<sub>LOC</sub> Ankara] hattı için indirimli satışlarını [<sub>MONEY</sub> 90 TL'den] başlatacağını açıkladı.

[<sub>ORG</sub> Turkish Airlines] announced that from this [<sub>TIME</sub> Monday] on it will start its discounted fares of [<sub>MONEY</sub> 90TL] for [<sub>LOC</sub> İstanbul] [<sub>LOC</sub> Ankara] route.

See the Table below for typical generic named entity types.

|Tag|Sample Categories|
|---|---|
|PERSON|people, characters|
|ORGANIZATION|companies, teams|
|LOCATION|regions, mountains, seas|
|TIME|time expressions|
|MONEY|monetarial expressions|

For Developers
============

You can also see [Java](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition), [Python](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-Py), [Cython](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-Cy), [Js](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-Js), [C#](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-CS), [Swift](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-Swift), or [C++](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-CPP) repository.

## Requirements

* [Php 8.4 or higher](#php)
* [Git](#git)

### Php 

To check if you have a compatible version of Php installed, use the following command:

    php -V
    
You can find the latest version of Php [here](https://www.php.net/downloads/).

### Git

Install the [latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Download Code

In order to work on code, create a fork from GitHub page. 
Use Git for cloning the code to your local or below line for Ubuntu:

	git clone <your-fork-git-link>

A directory called NamedEntityRecognition will be created. Or you can use below link for exploring the code:

	git clone https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishNamedEntityRecognition-Php.git

## Open project with PhpStorm IDE

Steps for opening the cloned project:

* Start IDE
* Select **File | Open** from main menu
* Choose `NamedEntityRecognition-Php` file
* Select open as project option
* Couple of seconds, dependencies will be downloaded.

For Contibutors
============

### composer.json file

1. autoload is important when this package will be imported.
```
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "olcaytaner\\WordNet\\": "src/"
    }
  },
```
2. Dependencies should be maximum (not only direct but also indirect references should also be given), everything directly in the code should be given here.
```
  "require-dev": {
    "phpunit/phpunit": "11.4.0",
    "olcaytaner/dictionary": "1.0.0",
    "olcaytaner/xmlparser": "1.0.1",
    "olcaytaner/morphologicalanalysis": "1.0.0"
  }
```

### Data files
1. Add data files to the project folder. Subprojects should include all data files of the parent projects.

### Php files

1. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    /**
     * Returns true if specified semantic relation type presents in the relations list.
     *
     * @param SemanticRelationType $relationType element whose presence in the list is to be tested
     * @return bool true if specified semantic relation type presents in the relations list
     */
    public function containsRelationType(SemanticRelationType $relationType): bool{
        foreach ($this->relations as $relation){
            if ($relation instanceof SematicRelation && $relation->getRelationType() == $relationType){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
2. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    public function getRelation(int $index): Relation{
```
3. Write getter and setter methods.
```
    public function getOrigin(): ?string
    public function setName(string $name): void
```
4. Use standard javascript test style by extending the TestCase class. Use setup when necessary.
```
class WordNetTest extends TestCase
{
    private WordNet $turkish;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        ini_set('memory_limit', '450M');
        $this->turkish = new WordNet();
    }

    public function testSize()
    {
        $this->assertEquals(78327, $this->turkish->size());
    }
```
5. Enumerated types should be declared with enum.
```
enum CategoryType
{
    case MATHEMATICS;
    case SPORT;
    case MUSIC;
    case SLANG;
    case BOTANIC;
```
6. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
    public function constructor1(string $path, string $fileName): void
    public function constructor2(string $path, string $extension, int $index): void
    public function __construct(string $path, string $extension, ?int $index = null)
```
7. Use __toString method if necessary to create strings from objects.
```
    public function __toString(): string
```
8. Use xmlparser package for parsing xml files.
```
  $doc = new XmlDocument("../test.xml");
  $doc->parse();
  $root = $doc->getFirstChild();
  $firstChild = $root->getFirstChild();
```
